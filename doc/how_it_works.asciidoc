= How the Code Works

There are three co-operating processes in this code.

. The hub process (Erlang), which communicates with the other two processes.
. The Java process. It gets a list of things to draw from the hub,
and sends the drawing environment to the hub.
. The sketch process (Erlang). It sends the hub things that it wants to draw,
and awaits the hub's response. This is necessary to make sure
that calls to the hub stay in order.

== Initial Handshaking

There is some initial handshaking kabuki, where the hub starts the Java
process and the two processes exchange +pid+s.

|======================
|Erlang hub||Java
|Open port to Java |->|Program starts
|register port||
|Send Node name to Java via port| ->|Get Erlang node name
|Get Java's +pid+|<-|Establish connection to Erlang node and send my +pid+ to Erlang
|Send Java my +pid+ and sketch dimensions|->|Receive +pid+ and dimensions
|Receive completion message|<-|Send completion message
|Start hub loop||Start +PApplet+
|======================

Once the handshaking is done, +PApplet+ is running, and it calls a Java
function named +setup()+, then +draw()+ 60 times a second. Here is the
communication between Java, the hub, and the sketch for the +draw()+ 
function; +setup()+ works the same way.

The "environment" referred to in the following table is the current
state of the +PApplet+: mouse position, previous mouse position, mouse
button (left/right/center), mouse pressed (true/false). The environment
as of this version doesn't include keypresses.

|======================
|Java||Hub||Sketch
|Send environment|->|Receive environment||
|Receive +ok+|<-|Send +ok+||
|Send +draw+ and wait|->|Set drawing list to +[]+ and spawn +draw/0+|->|+draw/0+ starts
|||Add command to list|<-|Send a drawing command, then wait
|||Send +ok+ to sketch|->|Receive +ok+
|||Add command to list|<-|Send another drawing command, and wait
|||Send +ok+ to sketch|->|Receive +ok+
|||Receive +`EXIT'+|<-|+draw/0+ ends
|Execute command list|<-|Send list to Java||
